Each folder contains a unique README.md file with specific details regarding the Experience Target (the URL that is entered into the Monitor to... section when configuring a Web App Group - see image below) as well as any specific variables that will need to be defined for the script to work.

From the Source tab, select all of the items inside of the code box by either highlighting or clicking and performing a Select All command to highlight the full body of the code. You can then simply paste the copied script (from the earlier step indicated above) to write

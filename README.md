Each folder contains a unique README.md file with specific details regarding the Experience Target (the URL that is entered into the Monitor to... section when configuring a Web App Group - see image below) as well as any specific variables that will need to be defined for the script to work. Please note, variables are already included in the provided scripts so it is imperative that the variables be defined exactly as written to be valid when used by the script.

The html files in each folder contain the script described by the title pre-formatted to be copy and pasted straight into the AppNeta Performance Manager Workflow creation screen. 
To insert the scripts, simply select the entire body of the appropriate .html file here in GitHub and copy that data to your clipboard.
